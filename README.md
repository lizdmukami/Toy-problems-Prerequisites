# 3 Projects in One. Students Grader, Speed Detector,and Net Salary Calculator.

## CHALLENGE 1 - Students Grader

This program is meant to show the grade in regards to the marks input.

## Description

This program starts by prompting the user to input student marks. 

The input should be between 0 and 100. 

The output then corresponds to the correct grade, as shown below: 

        A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.
        
## CHALLENGE 2 - Speed Detector

This programm is meant to detect when the speed is high and demerit points.

## Description

This program takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. And if the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. 

Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

   > For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.
